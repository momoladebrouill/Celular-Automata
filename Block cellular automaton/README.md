# Rotation cellular automata

My goal here is to do the same than in this [video](http://dmishin.github.io/singlerot-smooth/singlerot-smooth.html)  
Currently, there is only the few first generations visibles in shell but i'm not sure it's suppose to work like that because it's seems to empty itself through generations :(
